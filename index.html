          <h3>Focused vs Diffuse</h3>

          <aside class="notes">
            Focused vs Diffuse Modes
            <ul><li>- Focused: Concentrating on something intensely</li>
            <li>- Diffuse: Relaxed thinking is related to a set of neural resting states</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Pinball</p>

            Using the Focused and Diffuse Modes
            <ul><li>Dali (artist) used to relax in a chair thinking loosely in a chair dangling keys in his hand until he dropped the keys when he was drifting off to sleep.  He would then get up and use all of his diffuse thoughts to go back to work ready to take them into the focused mode.
              </li>
              <li>  Edison also did this with ball bearings</li>
            </ul>
          </aside>

        <section>
          <h3>What is learning?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Tasks like seeing, hearing, reaching, running, etc...</li>
            <li>Tasks like solving math problems, studying new material, learning another language, etc...</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Seeing/hearing/reaching/running - Complex tasks are not consciously thought about doing—our subconscious takes care of it and we are not consciously aware of how our brains work.  Most of the heavy-lifting is done below our level of consciousness</li>
              <li>Brain has one million billion synapses.  Essentially, each day we wake up with a new brain. New connections form as others dissapear daily</li>
              <li>BrainFacts.org</li>
            </ul>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Procrastination</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you look at something you don’t want to do, your brain activates the pain sensory portion of your brain and naturally wants to find a way to make it stop</li>
            <li>If you force yourself to do the thing you didn’t like, you adapt</li>
            <li>If you're struggling to stay focused or get motivated, use the pomodoro technique</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Practice Makes Permanent</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Mathematical and scientific concepts may be harder to learn because we only have abstract concepts to work with</li>
            <li>The above argument also applies to learning a new language, design pattern, etc...</li>
            <li>The more abstract something is, the more important it is to practice using that thing</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>When you learn how to solve a problem, you make a neural pattern but it is still weak.  After you solve it from the start again, you strengthen it.  When you want to learn something, focus on it and then take a break—let your brain relax and slip into the diffuse mode.  It’s analogous to letting mortar dry when building a wall—if you cram too much, your foundation is going to be jumbled and not as strong.</li>
            </ul>

        <section>
          <h3>Memory</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>When you are trying to hold ideas in mind so you can use them to solve a problem, you are using Working memory.  Sometimes you’ll pull in long term memory</li>
            <li>Our brain is like a crappy chalkboard.  It has limited space and things get erased if we stop repeating something</li>
            <li>Short term memory is like the above mentioned chalkboard</li>
            <li>Long term memory is like a warehouse where things are stored all over--needs to be accessed or info is lost</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Working memory is what you’re immediately and consciously processing in your mind.  We used to think you could hold 7 chunks, but now it’s believed it’s only 4.</li>
            </ul>
          </aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Sleep (no, I'm not kidding)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Being awake creates toxic products in your brain.  They are removed by sleeping because your brain cells shrink and the toxic products can be washed away</li>
            <li>Sleep also allows your brain to tidy ideas and concepts you are learning</li>
            <li>Deactivation of the frontal cortex (conscious you) allows the rest of your brain to more easily talk to each other part and more easily learn the task you are trying to</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Chunking</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A chunk is the mental leap that helps you unite bits of information together through meaning</li>
            <li>When you’re focusing on something, it’s almost as if you have an octopus reaching through the 4 slots of working memory to help you make connections to other areas in your brain.  Under stress, the octopus is not able to do it’s job as well and makes it harder to make connections</li>
            <li>Build chuncks in the same way you learn how to play a new sport--bit by bit--until it becomes automatic</li>
            <li>Focus on the information you are trying to chunck</li>
          </ul>

          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>Experts can access a huge library of chunks</li>
              <li>Chuncks are compressed information you can interleave to comprehend complex concepts</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Memory Palace</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A great technique for remembering everything!</li>
            <li>Pick a place, define a route, place objects along the way, and practice recalling them</li>
            <li>It may sound odd, but it's the technique used world memory champions</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <ul>
              <li>We remember certain information better than others.  Like faces, pictures, etc. are much easier to remember than lists.</li>
              <li>Crazy is good when it comes to remembering things!</li>
              <li>We learn faces by divergences from what we've learned to be "normal"</li>
            </ul>
